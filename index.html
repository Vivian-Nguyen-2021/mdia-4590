	<h1>We are learning about Git and Github</h1>
	<p>We can push and pull our changes to and from a remote repository</p>

	<h2>Branches</h2>
	<p>Next we will learn about Branches. They help us work on new code without jeopardizing the integrity of the main codebase</p>
	<a href ="about.html">Learn about Branches</a>
	<h3>Environments</h3>
	<p>One way of organizing our code is to mimic the different environments for our project. For example, we may have one environment for developers, one for testing and collaboration, and one for a live site. In this case, we would have three branches as well. You may choose to call them development, staging, and master.</p>

	<h2>Merging</h2>
	<p>Merging is the action of including the code from one branch to another.</p>

	<p>Beware! if there is a change on one file and the same line is changed on another, the code cannot be automatically merged. This will result in a merge conflict. You may need to resolve these manually or with the assistance of additional software. Good luck!</p>
