	<h1>We are learning about Git and Github</h1>
	<p>We can push and pull our changes to and from a remote repository</p>

	<h2>Branches</h2>
	<p>Next we will learn about Branches. They help us work on new code without jeopardizing the integrity of the main codebase</p>

	<h3>Environments</h3>
	<p>One way of organizing our code is to mimic the different environments for our project. For example, we may have one environment for developers, one for testing and collaboration, and one for a live site. In this case, we would have three branches as well. You may choose to call them development, staging, and master.</p>
